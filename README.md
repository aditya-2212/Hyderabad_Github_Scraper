# Hyderabad_Github_Scraper
- Using the GitHub API, I collected detailed data on GitHub users located in Hyderabad with over 50 followers, including each userâ€™s profile information and up to 500 of their most recent public repositories, providing a comprehensive view of their GitHub activity.
- A notable finding is that users with well-crafted bios and publicly visible emails tend to attract a higher follower count, suggesting the impact of profile completeness on follower engagement.
- To increase visibility, developers should consider adding a descriptive bio and contact information to their GitHub profiles, potentially boosting engagement, attracting followers, and creating more networking or hiring opportunities.
